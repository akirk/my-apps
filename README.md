A WordPress app launcher.

## Description

This plugin adds a `/my-apps/` route to your WordPress so that it can act as your personal apps launcher.

You can use your own WordPress as the place where you host apps in form of plugins. It can be hard to launch them since you have to navigate wp-admin. This adds a dashboard like an mobile phone launcher to your WordPress.

Plugin "Apps" can register their own icons but you can add your own links.
